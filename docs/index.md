# What is the Land Use Plus (LU+) Extension?
The Land Use Plus (LU+) extension allows users to incorporate a sequence of maps depicting changes in land use, land cover, or other user-defined disturbances. Map values correspond to prescribed forest changes where changes in map value trigger a prescribed forest change. Forest change prescriptions are derived from, and analogous to, the harvest prescriptions used in the Biomass Harvest extension.
