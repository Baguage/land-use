What is the Land Use Change Extension?
The Land Use Change (LUC+) extension allows users to incorporate a sequence of maps depicting changes in land use, land cover, or other user-defined disturbances. Map values correspond to prescribed forest changes where changes in map value trigger a prescribed forest change. Forest change prescriptions are derived from, and analogous to, the harvest prescription s used in the Biomass Harvest extension.

Features
 Incorporate land use, land cover change, or forest stressor into LANDIS-II simulations.
 Create reactive land use or land cover changes using PAUSE functionality.
 Simulate forest stressors (i.e. disturbance caused by insects).
 Remove biomass according to user-defined land cover class prescriptions.
