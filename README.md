## Developers

_(Under construction)_

* What a developer needs to build the extension
  * Basic stuff common to all extensions -- need L-II installed, SDK, and a C# compiler
    (Visual Studio on Windows, MonoDevelop on OS-X and Linux)
    * Eventually, this content should be put in a shared location for developer resources, so all extensions could simply
      link to it instead of duplicating the content.
  * How to make a copy of the extension in the L-II build directory available to L-II for testing
* Info about packaging and releasing the extension
  * How-to guide (step-by-step instructions) for making and deploying a release
